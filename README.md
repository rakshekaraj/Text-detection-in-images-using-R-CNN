## üìö **Introduction**

Text detection in images is a crucial step in various applications such as:
- Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
- Autonomous driving (reading road signs)
- Content digitization
- Assistive technologies for the visually impaired

This project leverages the power of **R-CNN** to effectively detect text regions in images, ensuring high precision and recall even in challenging scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds or varying lighting conditions.

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Technical Approach**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Dataset Preparation**
- Images containing text were collected and preprocessed for training.
- Annotation tools were used to create bounding boxes around text regions.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Model Architecture**
- **Base Model**: The R-CNN architecture is adapted for text detection.
- **Steps**:
  - Region proposal generation using Selective Search.
  - Feature extraction from proposed regions using a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet or VGG).
  - Classification and bounding-box regression for text regions.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Training Pipeline**
- Loss functions:
  - Classification Loss: Cross-Entropy.
  - Bounding Box Regression Loss: Smooth L1 Loss.
- Optimizer: Adam/SGD.
- Data augmentation techniques were employed to improve generalization.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Evaluation Metrics**
- Precision, Recall, and F1-Score were used to evaluate model performance.
- Intersection over Union (IoU) was computed for bounding box accuracy.
